Denote the distance between two observations \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_j\\) in the original space as \\(d_{ij}\\) and the distance in the subspace as \\(\\delta_{ij}\\). 11.2 Methods Depending on whether the magnitude of the original distance \\(d_{ij}\\) needs to be preserved as much as possible or just the relative distance (rank) to be preserved, multidimensional scaling can be classified as metric scaling and non-metric scaling. Metric scaling methods use the magnitude of \\(d_{ij}\\) to find the configuration of \\(\\delta_{ij}\\); while the non-metric scaling methods only use the ranking of \\(d_{ij}\\) to determine \\(\\delta_{ij}\\). 11.2.1 Classical Scaling The classical scaling is find \\(\\delta_{ij}\\) such that \\(\\delta_{ij} \\approx d_{ij}\\), i.e., the following stress function \\[ \\mbox{Stress}=\\left[\\frac{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}(\\delta_{ij}-d_{ij})^2}{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}\\delta_{ij}^2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\mbox{ is minimized}. \\] 11.2.2 Metric Scaling Metric scaling methods assume there exist a monotonic function \\(f\\) such that \\[ \\mbox{Stress}=\\left[\\frac{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}[\\delta_{ij}-f(d_{ij})]^2}{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}\\delta_{ij}^2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\mbox{ is minimized}. \\] For example, we can let \\(f(d_{ij})=\\alpha+\\beta d_{ij}\\). Numerical iteration procedures are used to search for the configuration \\(\\delta_{ij}\\), the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) such that the stress above is minimized. If the function \\(f(d_{ij})=d_{ij}\\), we have the classical scaling. ### Non-metric Scaling For non-metric scaling methods, the monotonic function \\(f\\) is implicitly defined to preserve the ranking of the original distance, i.e., \\[ d_{ij}&lt;d_{kl} \\Longrightarrow f(d_{ij})\\le f(d_{kl}) \\Longrightarrow \\delta_{ij}^{\\ast}\\le \\delta_{kl}^{\\ast} \\] where \\(\\delta_{ij}^{\\ast}\\) are not distance, they are just numbers representing the ranking of the original distance \\(d_{ij}\\). The configuration of \\(\\delta_{ij}\\) is obtained using numerical iterative methods such that the stress function \\[ \\mbox{Stress}=\\left[\\frac{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}[\\delta_{ij}-f(\\delta_{ij}^{\\ast})]^2}{\\dsum_{i&lt;j}\\delta_{ij}^2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\mbox{ is minimized}. \\] Non-metric scaling methods do not use the actual magnitude of \\(d_{ij}\\) to determine \\(\\delta_{ij}\\), only the rank of \\(d_{ij}\\) is used to guarantee that \\(\\delta_{ij}\\) maintains the same ranking as \\(d_{ij}\\). 11.3 Example The \\(\\verb`eurodist`\\) data in R consists of road distances (in km) between 21 cities in Europe. loc &lt;- cmdscale(eurodist) x &lt;- loc[,1] y &lt;- loc[,2] plot(x,y,type=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,asp=1) text(x,y,rownames(loc),cex=0.8) Does it make sense? We would expect Stockholm to be the most northern city of the bunch and Athens to be the most southern. Letâ€™s simply multiply the second column by -1. Plot of recovered from the distances gives a reasonably accurate representation of the actual locations of the European cities. loc=cmdscale(eurodist) # metric scaling x=loc[,1] y=-loc[,2] plot(x,y,type=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,asp=1) text(x,y,rownames(loc),cex=0.8) library(MASS) fit &lt;- isoMDS(eurodist,k=2, trace=F) # non-metric scaling x &lt;- fit$points[,1] y &lt;- -fit$points[,2] plot(x,y,type=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;) text(x,y,rownames(loc),cex=0.8) Revisit Learning Outcomes After finishing this chapter, students should be able to Explain the objective of multidimensional scaling.
